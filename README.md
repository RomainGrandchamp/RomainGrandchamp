### 👋 Hi, I’m [@RomainGrandchamp](https://github.com/RomainGrandchamp)

I am a Cognitive Neuroscience Research Engineer at the CNRS (French National Centre for Scientific Research). I specialize in bridging computational methods and neuroscience, focusing on understanding complex neural processes, especially related to cognitive functions related to meta cognition and consciousness, and more specifically mental immagery, attention and emotion regulation. I feed a strong interested in modified states of consciousness.

### 👀 I’m interested in ...
- Neural and cognitive mechanisms of consciousness and metacognition related to mental imagery, attention and emotions.
- Computational modeling and machine learning in neuroscience
- Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurotechnology
- Open-source tools for cognitive neuroscience research

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Advanced techniques in deep learning for brain imaging
- Multi-modal data integration in neuroscience
- The latest tools for reproducible neuroscience research

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Projects involving cognitive modeling or consciousness research
- Open-source initiatives for neuroscience tools and data analysis
- Interdisciplinary research bridging AI and cognitive neuroscience

### ⚡ Fun fact:
In addition to neuroscience, I have a keen interest in philosophy of mind and often explore philosophical perspectives on consciousness in my free time!
I love mongolian metal (the Hu rocks!) and mongolian Khoomii throat Singing.
